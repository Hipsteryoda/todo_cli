# todo_cli
cli interface for managing tasks in central Obsidian file

## Future Ideas
1. Implement a database for storing tasks and task attributes.
    1. From database, fetch tasks and write to working Obsidian file.
2. Implement a cleanup that removes completed tasks from the todo file after a certain amount of time.

# Configuration
1. Add a `config.py` file with the constant `TODO_FILE_PATH` pointing to your desired todo file.
